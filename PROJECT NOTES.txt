Notes on dropdown menus and modals:

  Dropdown buttons toggle menu display.  When a dropdown menu is visible,
  any click on or outside the dropdown will cause function window.onclick
  to close the dropdown.

  Overlays are displayed through dropdown menu items.  A click on any overlay link
  or the close button closes the overlay directly through function handleButton.

  Modals are displayed through dropdown menu items.  A click on the modal background
  (outside the modal content) causes function window.onclick to close the modal.
  The close button closes the modal directly through function handleButton.
